## Abstract
The focus of this paper is to discuss the collaborative mapping strategies of contributors in uncharted territories, using North Korea as a case study. OpenStreetMap (OSM) enables “armchair mappers” to map opaque territories such as North Korea in which the government has  controlled internet access to its residents. Here, I ask the questions of who is mapping to North Korea, which tools and methods the contributors use to have access and represent North Korea, and which are the motivations behind such mapping endeavor. To do this, I analyze the technical aspects of OSM data in North Korea, and analyze the structured correspondence I exchanged with 889 contributors. 

## Data
OpenStreetMap data is used for the research for aggregating the changeset data, I extracted the center point of each boundary that each changeset has. 

- North Korean Region data in OpenStreetMap (OSM) downloaded from Geofabrik(http://download.geofabrik.de/)
- ~210 Correspondence with 889 contributors (Anonymized)

## License
OSM data is under the Open Database License (ODbL) version 1.0 share-alike license.
